Overview
========

The caribou project is aimed at multiphysics computation.
It brings a plugin that complements `SOFA multiphysics framework <https://www.sofa-framework.org>`_.
It also provides generic c++ utilities, and SOFA components such as solvers and forcefields.

The project is composed of two modules:

1. The **Caribou library** brings multiple geometric, linear analysis and topological tools that are designed to be as independent as possible from external projects.

2. The **Sofa caribou library** is built on top of the **caribou library**, but brings new components to the SOFA project as a plugin.
